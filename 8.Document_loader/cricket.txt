Cricket is a bat-and-ball team sport played by two teams of 11 players, where the goal is to score more runs than the opposing team. Played on a large, oval field with a rectangular pitch at the center, the game involves a bowler throwing a hard ball at a batter who tries to hit it and score runs by running between two wickets. The game is divided into innings, with teams alternating between batting and bowling, and a team wins by scoring the most runs after both have batted.
